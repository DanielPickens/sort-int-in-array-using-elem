My code solution that solves an algorithmic equation 


My code in my created file : main.py, will solve efficiently in O(n^2) , this algo: 



Given two sorted arrays, count the number of equal pairs, one from each array.

Input: A = [1, 2, 2], B = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3]
Output: 9
Explanation: 3 pairs of (1, 1) and 6 pairs of (2, 2)
